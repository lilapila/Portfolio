# Portfolio
## Software tester's portfolio - draft


## About me
I am a fluent English speaker with 16 years of professional experience in education, quality assurance, and customer service. Over a year ago, I made a conscious decision to start a new career path as a **software tester** and, now, I am anxious and more than ready to do so.
As an ambitious and highly motivated learner,  I've been systematically developing my technical skills through self-study and participation in courses.  I've learned testing theory based on the ISTQB syllabus, Agile project management methodologies, SQL, Jira & Confluence, REST API testing, HTML/CSS basics, Chrome DevTools, etc.

Throughout the course of my career, I've perfected my soft skills, such as excellent communication and collaboration, fostering good relations, team management, and effective work in stressful situations. I’m a consistent problem-solver with analytical and critical thinking abilities, able to prioritize and manage projects with proficiency. My creativity, optimism, openness, great work organization, and self-discipline in achieving goals make me a valued employee and co-worker.

Why software testing? Why not? :)
